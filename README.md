# ðŸš¨Deprecated ðŸš¨

## We are announcing the deprecation of the utpm-c library support and DPS-TPM authentication support within the Azure IoT C-SDK. Starting May 2023, Microsoft will not provide support for this library. Existing applications using this library will continue to work as-is. We strongly recommend switching to DPS-X509 authentication using the [tpm2tss OpenSSL Engine](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/main/iothub_client/devdoc/iothubclient_c_library.md#openssl-engine-examples)
